# Open Faldon Bug Tracker
Bug Tracking for the Open Faldon project

Faldon is a small MMO game created wholly by James Bellinger (known as "Zer") and Illusory Studios. We neither have nor claim any copyright to his work, and appreciate all his team did in the active development of Faldon. Open Faldon is a free to play shard based on this forgotten gem of retro gaming goodness.

This is a GitHub where our team will track issues, bugs and balance requests (all called "Issues" by GitHub) here on this site. I can promise a 48 hour response time in most cases. Some tickets may be closed without proper resolution, but we'll do our best to fix up things.
